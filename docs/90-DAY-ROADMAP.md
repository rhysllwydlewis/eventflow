## Deferred to Future (Not in 90-Day Scope)

Documented in `/FUTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md`:

- Account manager program (delay until 100+ paying suppliers)
- Calendar sync integrations (delay until top 3 supplier request)
- PWA mobile app (delay until 40%+ mobile traffic)
- Success fee model (too complex for MVP)
- Seasonal boost ads (need seasonal traffic data first)
- Advanced integrations (Zapier, etc.)

---

## Questions for Product Team

1. **Stripe Account**: Do we have Stripe account set up for production? ✅ (Yes, already configured)
2. **Twilio**: Approved for SMS verification flow?
3. **Founding Suppliers**: Do we have 25-30 real suppliers willing to be "founding suppliers" or should these be realistic demos? → **Decision: Use realistic demo data**
4. **Pricing**: Confirm trial price (£49 vs £39)? → **Confirmed: £49**
5. **Manual Verification**: Who will handle business verification reviews? → **Admin team**
