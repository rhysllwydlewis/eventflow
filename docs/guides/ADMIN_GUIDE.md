## Security Best Practices

1. **Regular Audits**
   - Review audit logs weekly
   - Monitor for suspicious activity
   - Track admin privilege changes

2. **Data Protection**
   - Only export data when necessary
   - Securely store exported files
   - Delete exports after use

3. **User Privacy**
   - Respect GDPR requirements
   - Only access user data when required
   - Document reasons for account modifications

4. **Admin Privileges**
   - Grant admin access sparingly
   - Regularly review admin users
   - Revoke access when no longer needed

## Admin Architecture

This section describes the technical conventions used across the admin frontend and backend. Follow these patterns when contributing to or extending admin pages.

### Route Structure

All admin API endpoints are mounted under `/api/admin/` and handled in `routes/admin.js`. Data access is done through the `dbUnified` abstraction (see `utils/dbUnified.js`), which supports both the legacy flat-file store and MongoDB without requiring changes at the route level.

```
GET  /api/admin/users              # list users
PUT  /api/admin/users/:id          # update a user
POST /api/admin/users/:id/ban      # ban action
GET  /api/admin/suppliers          # list suppliers
...
```

All admin routes apply the `applyAuthRequired` middleware and then check `req.user.role === 'admin'` before proceeding.

### Frontend API Convention: `AdminShared.api()`

Admin pages **must** use `AdminShared.api()` for API calls instead of raw `fetch()`. This shared wrapper:

- Attaches `credentials: 'include'` automatically
- Attaches the `X-CSRF-Token` header for state-changing methods (POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Parses the JSON response and throws a descriptive `Error` on non-2xx status
- Redirects to `/auth` on 401 responses

**Usage:**

```javascript
// GET request
const data = await AdminShared.api('/api/admin/packages');

// POST request (CSRF token attached automatically)
await AdminShared.api('/api/admin/packages/123/approve', 'POST');

// PUT with body
await AdminShared.api('/api/admin/users/456', 'PUT', { name: 'New Name' });
```

### CSRF Handling

EventFlow implements CSRF protection using the **Double-Submit Cookie** pattern:

1. On page load the server sets two cookies: `csrf` and `csrfToken` (both non-HttpOnly).
2. `AdminShared.api()` reads `window.__CSRF_TOKEN__` (populated by `admin-shared.js` on init) and sends it as the `X-CSRF-Token` request header on write operations.
3. Server-side `middleware/csrf.js` validates that the header value matches the cookie.

This is handled transparently by `AdminShared.api()`. If you ever need to make a raw `fetch()` call in an admin page (avoid this where possible), attach the token manually:

```javascript
const token = window.__CSRF_TOKEN__ || '';
fetch('/api/admin/...', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json', 'X-CSRF-Token': token },
  credentials: 'include',
  body: JSON.stringify(payload),
});
```

### Avoiding Inline Styles

Inline `style="..."` attributes and `<style>` blocks inside admin HTML files are **not permitted** for new code. All visual styling must live in the scoped admin CSS files:

| CSS file                                        | Purpose                          |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `public/assets/css/admin.css`                   | Core admin layout and typography |
| `public/assets/css/admin-enhanced.css`          | Enhanced admin components        |
| `public/assets/css/admin-navbar.css`            | Top navigation bar               |
| `public/assets/css/admin-cards.css`             | Card and panel components        |
| `public/assets/css/admin-packages-enhanced.css` | Package management page          |
| `public/assets/css/admin-ui-improvements.css`   | Misc UI improvements             |

When a JS-rendered table row or element needs styling, add a class to the relevant CSS file and apply it via `className` in the template string — **do not** set `style` attributes in JS.
