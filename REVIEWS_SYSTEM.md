## Frontend Integration

### 1. Include Required Files

Add to your HTML `<head>`:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/css/reviews.css" />
<script src="/assets/js/reviews.js" defer></script>
```

### 2. Add Review Widget

Include the widget HTML in your supplier page:

```html
<!-- Copy content from /public/components/review-widget.html -->
<div class="reviews-widget" id="reviews-widget">
  <!-- Widget content -->
</div>
```

### 3. Initialize JavaScript

```javascript
// Get supplier ID from URL or page data
const supplierId = 'sup_abc123';

// Get current user (if logged in)
const currentUser = {
  id: 'usr_xyz789',
  name: 'John Doe',
  role: 'customer',
};

// Initialize review system
if (window.reviewsManager) {
  reviewsManager.init(supplierId, currentUser);
}
```

### 4. Customization

The review system can be customized via CSS variables or by overriding the default styles in `reviews.css`.

## Anti-Abuse Strategy

### Rate Limiting

- **Per IP**: Maximum 5 reviews per hour
- **Per User/Supplier**: One review every 30 days
- **Enforced at**: API level with hashed IP tracking

### Spam Detection

The system automatically flags reviews that match any of these patterns:

1. **Spam Keywords**: URLs, promotional language, call-to-action phrases
2. **Competitor Domains**: Email addresses from known competitor domains
3. **New Account Pattern**: Accounts less than 1 day old giving 5-star reviews
4. **Temporal Clustering**: Multiple reviews for same supplier within 1 hour
5. **Suspicious Patterns**: Multiple 5-star reviews from new accounts

### Moderation Workflow

1. Review submitted by customer
2. Automatic spam detection runs
3. If flagged: Review goes to moderation queue
4. If clean: Review auto-approved and displayed
5. Admin reviews flagged content
6. Admin approves or rejects with reason
7. Moderation action logged in audit trail

## Trust Score Calculation

Trust score is calculated on a 0-100 scale:

```javascript
trustScore =
  averageRating * 15 + // Max 75 points
  min(totalReviews / 100, 1) * 10 + // Max 10 points for volume
  verifiedReviewRate * 10 + // Max 10 points for verification
  min(responseRate / 10, 5); // Max 5 points for responsiveness
```

## Badge System

Badges are automatically awarded based on analytics:

| Badge                 | Criteria                                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Top Rated**         | 4.8+ stars AND 10+ reviews                       |
| **Responsive**        | <2 hour avg response time AND 80%+ response rate |
| **Highly Reviewed**   | 50+ reviews                                      |
| **Customer Favorite** | 4.7+ stars AND 100+ reviews                      |

## Security Considerations

### XSS Prevention

- All user input is sanitized server-side
- HTML escaped before rendering client-side
- Content Security Policy headers recommended

### CSRF Protection

- All POST requests require CSRF token
- Token included in request headers
- Validated server-side

### IP Hashing

- IP addresses are hashed using SHA-256
- Never stored in plain text
- Used only for rate limiting

### Data Privacy

- User names displayed, but can be pseudonymized
- Email addresses never displayed publicly
- GDPR-compliant data handling

## Mobile Responsiveness

The review system is fully responsive with breakpoints at:

- **768px**: Tablet layout adjustments
- **480px**: Mobile optimizations

Features:

- Touch-friendly buttons and controls
- Optimized modal for small screens
- Collapsible filters on mobile
- Readable typography across devices

## Accessibility

WCAG 2.1 AA compliant features:

- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus indicators
- Color contrast ratios meet standards
- Reduced motion support

## Performance

- **Lazy loading**: Reviews loaded on demand
- **Pagination**: Prevents large data transfers
- **Debounced filtering**: Reduces API calls
- **Cached analytics**: Trust scores pre-calculated
- **Indexed queries**: MongoDB indexes for fast lookups

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Submit review (authenticated user)
- [ ] Submit review (unauthenticated - should redirect)
