- `404` - Not Found
- `429` - Too Many Requests (rate limit exceeded)
- `500` - Internal Server Error

## Rate Limiting

### Authentication Endpoints

- **Limit:** 100 requests per 15 minutes
- **Applies to:** `/api/auth/*`

### Write Operations

- **Limit:** 80 requests per 10 minutes
- **Applies to:** POST, PUT, DELETE operations

Rate limit headers are included in responses:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 95
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1234567890
```

## Image Processing

All uploaded images are automatically processed into multiple sizes:

1. **Thumbnail** - 300x300px, 80% quality, cover fit
2. **Optimized** - 1200x1200px max, 85% quality, inside fit
3. **Large** - 2000x2000px max, 90% quality, inside fit
4. **Original** - Preserved for backup

Images are converted to JPEG format with progressive loading and optimized using mozjpeg.

## Storage Options

### Local Storage (Development)

Images stored in `/uploads` directory and served at `/uploads/*`

### AWS S3 (Production)

Configure these environment variables:

```
AWS_S3_BUCKET=your-bucket-name
AWS_S3_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
```

When S3 is configured, images are automatically uploaded to S3 and URLs point to S3.

## Best Practices

1. **Always check authentication status** before making protected API calls
2. **Handle rate limits** gracefully with exponential backoff
3. **Validate file sizes** on the client before uploading
4. **Use pagination** for large result sets
5. **Cache search results** when appropriate
6. **Respect photo approval workflow** - display only approved photos to end users
