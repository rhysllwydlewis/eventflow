## 🚀 Quick Start - Production Deployment

**Deploying to production (Railway, Heroku, etc.)?** Follow these steps to avoid 502 errors:

### Prerequisites

- ✅ Node.js 20 LTS (v20.x) — **Node 22+ is not supported** (sharp may crash with "Bus error")
- ✅ **MongoDB Atlas account (free tier available)** ← Most important!
- ✅ Deployment platform account (Railway, Heroku, etc.)

### Essential Steps (15 minutes)

1. **Set up MongoDB Atlas** (Required - app won't start without this!)
   - 📚 **[Follow our simple step-by-step guide →](.github/docs/MONGODB_SETUP_SIMPLE.md)** (no technical knowledge needed)
   - 📚 Or see [MONGODB_SETUP.md](.github/docs/MONGODB_SETUP.md) for technical details
   - Get your connection string from MongoDB Atlas

2. **Configure Environment Variables** on your deployment platform:

   ```bash
   # Required
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://your-actual-connection-string
   JWT_SECRET=your-random-secret-min-32-chars
   NODE_ENV=production
   BASE_URL=https://event-flow.co.uk

   # Recommended (optional)
   EMAIL_ENABLED=true
   POSTMARK_API_KEY=your-server-token
   POSTMARK_FROM=admin@yourdomain.com
   ```

3. **Deploy your app** - Push to your platform (Railway, Heroku, etc.)

4. **Verify it works** - Visit `https://event-flow.co.uk/api/health`
   - Should show `"databaseStatus": "connected"`

### Troubleshooting 502 Errors

Getting "502 Bad Gateway" or "connection refused" errors? This usually means MongoDB isn't configured:

| Error Message                                   | Solution                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Invalid scheme, expected connection string..." | You're using the placeholder from `.env.example`. Get your real connection string from MongoDB Atlas - [see guide](.github/docs/MONGODB_SETUP_SIMPLE.md) |
| "Authentication failed" or "bad auth"           | Wrong password in connection string. Reset it in MongoDB Atlas → Database Access                                                                         |
| "Connection timeout" or "ENOTFOUND"             | IP not whitelisted. Add `0.0.0.0/0` in MongoDB Atlas → Network Access                                                                                    |
| "No cloud database configured"                  | `MONGODB_URI` environment variable not set on your deployment platform                                                                                   |

### HTTPS & Transport Security

- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All HTTP requests are redirected to HTTPS in production
- **HSTS**: HTTP Strict Transport Security enabled with 1-year max-age
- **Secure Cookies**: Authentication cookies use `httpOnly`, `secure` (production), and `sameSite` flags

### Security & Performance

- ✅ **Rate Limiting** - Protects against abuse with endpoint-specific limits
  - Authentication: 10 requests / 15 minutes
  - AI/OpenAI: 50 requests / hour
  - File Uploads: 20 requests / 15 minutes
  - Search/Discovery: 30 requests / minute
  - Notifications: 50 requests / 5 minutes
- ✅ **Input Validation** - Express-validator for all user inputs
- ✅ **Security Headers** - Helmet.js with CSP, HSTS, and other protections
- ✅ **API Versioning** - `/api/v1/` prefix with backward compatibility
- ✅ **CSRF Protection** - Token-based protection for all state-changing operations
- ✅ **MongoDB Sanitization** - Prevents NoSQL injection attacks
- ✅ **Password Hashing** - Bcrypt with salt rounds
- 📚 **[Full Security Documentation →](docs/SECURITY_FEATURES.md)** Headers (via Helmet)

- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Restricts resource loading to trusted domains
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking with `DENY`
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME-sniffing with `nosniff`
- **Referrer-Policy**: Set to `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`

### Input Validation & Sanitization

- MongoDB query sanitization via `express-mongo-sanitize`
- Input validation using `validator` library
- Rate limiting on authentication and write endpoints

### Monitoring

- CSP violation reporting endpoint at `/api/csp-report`
- Sentry integration for error tracking
- Audit logging for admin actions

## ⚡ Performance

EventFlow implements comprehensive performance optimizations for production deployments:

### Compression Strategy

- **Brotli Compression**: Primary compression method (15-20% better than gzip)
- **Gzip Fallback**: Automatic fallback for older clients
- **Selective Compression**: Only compresses text-based content > 1KB
- **Quality Tuning**: Balanced compression levels for optimal speed/size ratio
  - Brotli quality: 4 (good for dynamic content)
  - Gzip level: 6 (default balanced setting)

**Verify Compression:**

```bash
curl -H "Accept-Encoding: br" -I https://yourdomain.com/
# Should return: Content-Encoding: br
```

### Caching Strategy

EventFlow uses a multi-tier caching strategy for optimal performance:

- **HTML Pages**: 5-minute cache (`max-age=300, must-revalidate`)
- **Versioned Assets** (hashed filenames): 1-year cache (`max-age=31536000, immutable`)
- **Static Assets** (CSS/JS/images): 1-week cache (`max-age=604800, must-revalidate`)
- **User Uploads**: 1-year cache (`max-age=31536000, immutable`)

**Verify Caching:**

```bash
curl -I https://yourdomain.com/assets/css/styles.css
# Should return: Cache-Control: public, max-age=604800, must-revalidate
```

### Asset Optimization

- **Minified Assets**: CSS (~292KB) and JS (~1.2MB) are production-ready
- **Optimized Favicon**: 245 bytes SVG (extremely small)
- **Deferred Loading**: JavaScript loads with `defer` attribute
- **Lazy Loading**: Images load on-demand as they enter viewport

### Performance Verification

EventFlow includes a built-in performance verification endpoint:

```bash
# Check compression and caching configuration
curl http://localhost:3000/api/performance
```

**Response includes:**

- Client compression support (Brotli, gzip, deflate)
- Server compression configuration
- Caching strategy documentation
- Performance recommendations

**Full Testing Guide:** See [docs/PERFORMANCE_TESTING.md](docs/PERFORMANCE_TESTING.md)

### Image Optimization

- **Sharp** library for server-side image processing
- WebP format generation for modern browsers
- Responsive image sizes (thumbnail, large, optimized)
- Automatic thumbnail generation on upload

### CDN Recommendation

For production deployments, we recommend adding Cloudflare in front of Railway for:

- Global CDN with edge caching
- DDoS protection
- Additional image optimization
- Automatic Brotli compression

See `docs/CLOUDFLARE_SETUP.md` for setup instructions (coming soon).

## 📱 User Flows & Pages

### Email Verification Flow

EventFlow implements a secure email verification system for new user accounts:

**User Journey:**

1. User registers for an account at `/auth.html`
2. System sends verification email with a unique 24-hour token via Postmark
3. User clicks verification link in email → redirects to `/verify.html?token=<token>`
4. Page automatically calls `/api/auth/verify` API with the token
5. System displays branded verification status:
   - ✅ **Success**: "Email Verified!" with auto-redirect to appropriate dashboard
   - ❌ **Expired**: Shows expiration message with resend form
   - ❌ **Invalid**: Shows invalid token message with resend form
   - ⚠️ **No Token**: Shows instructions with resend form
6. After successful verification, user is redirected to:
   - Admin users → `/admin.html`
   - Supplier users → `/dashboard-supplier.html`
   - Customer users → `/dashboard-customer.html`

**Features:**

- Token-based verification with 24-hour expiration for security
- Branded UI with appropriate icons and messages for all states
- Resend verification email functionality
- Auto-redirect after successful verification
- Manual navigation buttons (Go to Dashboard, Go to Home)
- Email validation and error handling

### Package Detail Page Flow

Users can browse and view detailed information about service packages:

**User Journey:**

1. User discovers packages on homepage featured carousel or category pages
2. Clicks on package card → navigates to `/package.html?slug=<package-slug>`
3. Page loads full package details via `/api/packages/:slug` API
4. User views comprehensive package information and supplier details
5. User can:
   - Browse package photo gallery
   - Read full description and pricing
   - View tags and categories
   - See supplier profile information
   - Message the supplier (requires authentication)
   - Navigate to supplier's other packages

- API Endpoint: `GET /api/packages/:slug`
- JavaScript Handler: `/assets/js/pages/package-init.js` (inline in package.html)
- Components Used:
  - `PackageGallery` - Image gallery component
  - `SupplierCard` - Supplier information display
  - `MessageSupplierPanel` - Messaging interface
- Authentication: Required only for messaging functionality

## 🔧 Environment Variables

**Required for Production:**

```env
# Database - MOST IMPORTANT! App won't start without this
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net/eventflow
# 👆 Get this from MongoDB Atlas - see .github/docs/MONGODB_SETUP_SIMPLE.md

# Security
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-min-32-chars

# Environment
NODE_ENV=production
BASE_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

**Recommended (Email functionality):**

```env
EMAIL_ENABLED=true
POSTMARK_API_KEY=your-server-token
POSTMARK_FROM=admin@yourdomain.com
```

**Optional - AWS S3:**

```env
AWS_S3_BUCKET=your-bucket
AWS_S3_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret
```

**⚠️ Common mistake:** Using the placeholder value from `.env.example` will cause 502 errors!  
Get your real connection string: **[MongoDB Setup Guide](.github/docs/MONGODB_SETUP_SIMPLE.md)**

See [.env.example](.env.example) for all options.

### Database Configuration

**EventFlow uses MongoDB Atlas as the primary database for production deployments:**

1. **MongoDB Atlas (PRIMARY - Recommended for Production)**
   - The system automatically prioritizes MongoDB over local storage
   - All data (users, packages, posts, reviews, etc.) stored in MongoDB Atlas
   - Configured in `db-unified.js` to try MongoDB first
   - Set `MONGODB_URI` in environment variables with your Atlas connection string

   **Setup Instructions:**
   - Create a free MongoDB Atlas account at https://cloud.mongodb.com/
   - Follow the [MongoDB Setup Guide](.github/docs/MONGODB_SETUP_SIMPLE.md) for step-by-step instructions
   - Get your connection string and configure it in Railway or your hosting platform
   - **Important**: Never commit your actual connection string to git

   ```env
   # Production MongoDB Configuration
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   MONGODB_DB_NAME=eventflow
   ```

2. **Local Storage (Development Only)**
   - If MongoDB is not configured, falls back to local file storage
   - **Not suitable for production** - data is stored in JSON files
   - Useful for quick local development and testing

3. **File Storage (Photos & Media)**
   - Photos and media files are stored locally or in S3
   - Supplier photos are uploaded via the photo upload system
   - Set `STORAGE_TYPE` in `.env` (local or s3)

   ```env
   # Storage Configuration
   STORAGE_TYPE=local  # or 's3' for AWS S3
   ```

4. **How Database Priority Works**:
   - On startup, `db-unified.js` attempts MongoDB connection first (PRIMARY)
   - If MongoDB is not available, falls back to local files (dev only)
   - Check logs on startup for connection status:
     - `✅ Using MongoDB for data storage (PRIMARY)` - Production ready
     - `⚠️  Using local file storage` - Development only, not for production

**To verify your database is connected**: Check server logs after starting the app, or visit `/api/health` endpoint. You should see MongoDB status, not local storage in production.

**Production Deployment Checklist**:

- ✅ MongoDB Atlas account created and cluster configured
- ✅ Database user with read/write permissions created
- ✅ Network access configured (IP whitelist or allow all)
- ✅ `MONGODB_URI` environment variable set in Railway/hosting platform
- ✅ Connection string uses actual credentials (not placeholders)
- ✅ Never commit real credentials to git - use environment variables only

### Email Configuration

EventFlow uses **Postmark exclusively** for all transactional emails:

1. Sign up at https://postmarkapp.com
2. Get your Server API Token from the dashboard
3. Verify your sender domain or email address
4. Create message streams: `outbound` (default), `password-reset`, `broadcasts`
5. Add to `.env`:
   ```bash
   POSTMARK_API_KEY=your-server-token
   POSTMARK_FROM=admin@event-flow.co.uk
   EMAIL_ENABLED=true
   ```

**📖 Full Setup Guide:** See [POSTMARK_SETUP.md](./POSTMARK_SETUP.md) for detailed configuration instructions including webhooks.

During development without Postmark configured, emails are saved to `/outbox` folder for inspection.

**Production Email Checklist**:

- ✅ Postmark account created
- ✅ Server API token obtained
- ✅ Sender domain/email verified in Postmark
- ✅ Message streams configured (outbound, password-reset, broadcasts)
- ✅ `POSTMARK_API_KEY` environment variable set
- ✅ `POSTMARK_FROM` set to verified sender address (admin@event-flow.co.uk)
- ✅ Webhooks configured for delivery tracking (optional but recommended)
- ✅ Never commit API keys to git - use environment variables only

**Webhook URL (optional):** `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/postmark`

**WebSocket Server Modes:**

EventFlow includes two WebSocket servers for real-time features. Only ONE can run at a time (configured via `WEBSOCKET_MODE` environment variable):

- **v2** (default, recommended): Modern WebSocket server with real-time messaging, presence tracking, typing indicators, read receipts, and emoji reactions
- **v1** (legacy): Basic WebSocket server for real-time notifications only (backwards compatibility)
- **off**: Disables WebSocket (not recommended - disables all real-time features)

⚠️ **Important**: Running both v1 and v2 simultaneously will cause crashes with "server.handleUpgrade() was called more than once" errors. The `WEBSOCKET_MODE` environment variable ensures only one WebSocket server attaches to the HTTP server.

## 🗄️ Database Schema

**Collections:**

- `users` - Customer, supplier, admin accounts
- `suppliers` - Supplier business profiles
- `packages` - Service packages
- `reviews` - Supplier reviews and ratings
- `messages` - Customer-supplier messages
- `threads` - Message conversations
- `plans` - Customer event plans
- `notes` - Customer planning notes
- `events` - Event records
- `searchHistory` - User search history

All collections have:

- JSON schema validation
- Optimized indexes
- Automatic timestamps
