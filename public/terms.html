    <div class="card" style="max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto;">
      <p class="small" style="color:#667085;"><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 2024</p>

      <p>These Terms of Use (the "Terms") describe the terms and conditions on which EventFlow Limited, a company registered in England and Wales ("EventFlow," "we," "us," or "our") makes its website and services available to Users. These Terms apply to all websites and mobile applications owned and operated by us, including but not limited to www.event-flow.co.uk and related online services (collectively, the "Services").</p>

      <p>For details on how to contact us, please see Section 22 (Contact and Reporting) below.</p>

      <h2 class="h4">1. Your Acceptance of the Terms</h2>

      <p>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change or modify these Terms at any time. It is your responsibility to check the Terms periodically because any changes will be binding on you. By continuing to access or use the Services after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.</p>

      <h2 class="h4">2. The Services and Users</h2>
      <p>Through our Services we offer an innovative community and marketplace for the event planning industry. Our Services are only available to individuals who are at least 18 years of age and who can form legally binding contracts under applicable law.</p>

      <p>Users of our Services include:</p>

      </ul>

      <h3 class="h5">a. Customers</h3>
      <p>As a Customer, you acknowledge that while we use techniques to help verify the identity of Suppliers when they register, we cannot guarantee each Supplier's identity, capabilities, that they have obtained all required permits, licences or consents, or that they comply with all applicable laws. We do not personally endorse or recommend any particular Supplier nor do we guarantee the quality of their goods or services.</p>

      <h3 class="h5">b. Suppliers</h3>
      <p>As a Supplier you acknowledge that we will not personally recommend or endorse you or your products or services. We are in no way responsible for assisting you in reaching an agreement with Customers. Your membership or subscription to our Services may not be transferred or sold to another party.</p>

      <p>Suppliers must list the true and correct name of their business on the Services. Suppliers who engage in the sale of goods and services must have a valid business operations licence, as applicable.</p>

      <h2 class="h4">3. Role of EventFlow</h2>
      <p>As a User, you acknowledge that we are not a product or service provider, supplier, or an agent representative for any Supplier. We and the Services function solely as a neutral venue and digital platform where Users may connect for particular types of services or products. We are not involved in or a party to the actual transactions between Users.</p>

      <p>We have no control over the transactions that take place on our Services or the accuracy of any Supplier listings. We make no representations or warranties and are not liable or responsible for the actions or inactions of our Users.</p>

      <h2 class="h4">4. Nondiscrimination Policy</h2>
      <p>We want all Users to feel welcome and included on our Services. Accordingly, we prohibit discrimination against Users based on race, colour, religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, disability, marital status, family status, pregnancy status, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran or citizenship status, age, or any other characteristic protected under applicable law.</p>

      <p>This prohibition applies to the posting of discriminatory content, such as reviews or forum posts, on the Services. We will, at our discretion, take steps to enforce this policy, up to and including suspending from our Services those who violate this policy.</p>

      <h2 class="h4">5. Location of the Services</h2>
      <p>We control and operate the Services from our facilities in the United Kingdom. Unless otherwise specified, the materials displayed on the Services are presented solely for the purpose of promoting products and services available in the United Kingdom. We do not represent that materials on the Services are appropriate or available for use in other locations.</p>

      <h2 class="h4">6. Accounts, Passwords and Security</h2>
      <p>To access certain features of the Services, you may be required to register and create an account.

Be sure to protect the confidentiality of your account password. We are not liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to protect your password or account information.</p>
      
      <p>You must notify us immediately if you suspect any unauthorised use of your account or any security breach. You should use a strong, unique password and never share your login credentials with anyone. If we have reason to believe your account has been compromised, we may temporarily suspend your account while we investigate. You may not use another user's account without permission, and you may not allow others to use your account.</p>
